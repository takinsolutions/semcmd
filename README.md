## Takin.solutions SemCMD Repository ##

This repository serves as a store for the software  development efforts around the SemCMD package for Arches. 

SemCMD is a tool designed to support the information management process itself, especially in the context of data integration projects. In the contemporary information management environment, the sheer volume and diversity of data and software tools alongside the variety of new projects launched at any one moment makes the prospect of data integration at once ever more necessary and ever more daunting. This is the problem space in which SemCMD is designed to intercede. 

SemCMD is, as it were, a database of databases. It provides a tool for tracking and managing data and software projects in both their technical and human contexts. This means providing a documentation framework for recording and tracking projects, services, datasets, software and the human agents and groups that manage and maintain them. The goal of such a database is to support information specialists focussing on long term data integration and management that spans across individual efforts and groups and over the long term. 

SemCMD is designed for organizations such as research infrastructures, libaries and archives and other groups that have wide data management responsibilities who must therefore be supported with the ability to track the evolution of an information environment over time.

The data modelling design of this project has been founded on a reuse of 

- the Parthenos Entities ontology (https://www.parthenos-project.eu, WP5)

alongside the implementation of 

- the Project Layer Description Model (https://zellij.pythonanywhere.com/docs/list/app8rHfEiYQLOVrtc?flag=0)
